This is an e-commerce app, that will enable customers (literally anyone) to shop for groceries, clothes, kitchen appliances (lol...literally anything) from the convenience of their homes. A customer will be able to browse any product by category or search for it in the search bar, and purchase using an online payment system. Admin will be able to upload new  items to the app, update and delete existing ones, as well as track deliveries.
